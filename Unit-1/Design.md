# Design Process

The process of moving from the abstract data model to the implementation of the database proceeeds in two final design phases:

- Logical Design Phase
- Physical Design Phase

## Entity Realtionship Model

Entity: An object in the real world is an entity.

Relationship: It is a association among several entities.
Entity Set: Set of all entities of the same type.
Relationship Set: Set of all relationships of the same type.

```text
The overall of the logical structure of the database can be represented using graphical notations by ER-Diagram.-(UML)
```

```text
Entity are represented by: Rectangle
Relationship are represented by: Diamond
```

- Normalization: Normalization is the method to design the relational database. It is the process to avoid redundant information and also inability to represent the certain information.

E-R Model have three concepts:

- Entity Set
- Relationship set
- Attributes

1. Entity Set- An entity set is a set of entities of the same type that sahres the same attribute.

2. Attribute - An attribute is a property of the entity.
